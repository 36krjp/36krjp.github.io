It&#8217;s chunky, rounded body is faintly reminiscent of the original iPhone, yet simultaneously modern-looking and very satisfying to hold. The Apple Watch is also pleasingly comfortable on the wrist.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-261 alignleft\" src=\"https:\/\/jannah.tielabs.com\/jannah-tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/10\/2014\/04\/hermes_large-253x300.png\" alt=\"hermes_large\" width=\"253\" height=\"300\" \/>We&#8217;ve seen lots of fitness trackers over the years, and they&#8217;ve typically struck us as pretty formulaic: plasticky wristbands with little fashion appeal. One activity tracker brand tried to convince us that their activity tracker was designed to appeal to a fashion-conscious woman; they even thought that women would wear it around their neck like a necklace. But at the end of the day, it wasn&#8217;t jewellery. None of the fitness trackers on the market are.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a similar story with smartwatches. Sure, over the past year they&#8217;ve become more and more popular with guys looking for the latest tech gadget, but they don&#8217;t appeal to everyone. One major issue is that most smartwatches are designed for men. They wouldn&#8217;t sit comfortably on a smaller wrist.<\/p>\n\n\t\t<div id=\"dimensions\" data-title=\"Dimensions\" class=\"index-title\"><\/div>\n\t\n<h2>Apple Watch review: Dimensions<\/h2>\n<p>There are two sizes of watch: the 38mm model (which actually measures 38.6 by 33.3 mm) and the 42mm model (which measures 42 by 35.9 mm). Both have a thickness of 10.5mm.<\/p>\n\n\t\t<div class=\"checklist tie-list-shortcode\">\n<ul>\n<li>38mm model: 38.6 x 33.3 x 10.5mm<\/li>\n<li>42mm model: 42.0 x 35.9 x 10.5mm<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\n<p><em>Here&#8217;s how a 38mm Apple Watch looks on Karen&#8217;s wrist:<\/em><\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\t\t<div class=\"tie-full-width-img\">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/jannah.tielabs.com\/jannah-tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/10\/2016\/10\/slide-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-5 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/jannah.tielabs.com\/jannah-tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/10\/2016\/10\/slide-1.jpg\" alt=\"slide-1\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" \/><\/a>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\t\t<div id=\"build-quality\" data-title=\"Build quality\" class=\"index-title\"><\/div>\n\t\n\n\t\t<div class=\"tie-padding  has-padding-left has-padding-right\" style=\"padding-left:5%; padding-right:5%; padding-top:0; padding-bottom:0;\">\n\n\t\t\t<p>\n<h2>Apple Watch review: Build quality<\/h2>\n<p>Speaking of the materials the watch is made from, there are three options: aluminium for the Watch Sport, stainless steel for the Watch, and 18-carat gold for the Watch Edition. The Watch and Watch Edition come with sapphire screens, the Sport version with ion-x glass.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft wp-image-272\" src=\"https:\/\/jannah.tielabs.com\/jannah-tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/10\/2014\/04\/pexels-photo-28222.jpg\" alt=\"pexels-photo-28222\" width=\"300\" height=\"426\" \/>We love the look and feel of the Apple Watch. As we mentioned above, it looks a bit like a shrunk-down version of the original iPhone, and it&#8217;s reassuringly robust &#8211; after almost a year with the Watch, there\u00a0no scratches on the body or screen, although the brighter of our two Sport Band straps is starting to look a bit grubby.<\/p>\n<p>Apple doesn&#8217;t recommend dunking your Apple Watch first-gen in water. While the watch is rated as water-resistant to the IPX7 standard, which should mean it will survive in water up to a depth of 1 metre for up to 30 minutes, Apple describes it as &#8220;splash- and water-resistant but not waterproof&#8221;. So it&#8217;s ok to use it in the shower &#8211; as Apple&#8217;s CEO Tim Cook apparently does &#8211; but it&#8217;s not to be taken swimming.<\/p>\n\n\t\t<div class=\"tie-padding  has-padding-left has-padding-right\" style=\"padding-left:5%; padding-right:5%; padding-top:0; padding-bottom:0;\">\n\n\t\t\t<p>Having said that, plenty of reckless reviewers have done exactly that, and we&#8217;ve yet to hear anyone complain that their watch was damaged by the experience. We don&#8217;t recommend taking the risk, and you obviously won&#8217;t have a leg to stand on with Apple if something does go wrong since they&#8217;ve been careful to only claim it&#8217;s water-<em>resistant<\/em>. But it appears that yes, the Apple Watch is waterproof.<\/p>\n\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\t\t<div id=\"straps\" data-title=\"Straps\" class=\"index-title\"><\/div>\n\t\n\n\t\t<div class=\"tie-padding  has-padding-left has-padding-right\" style=\"padding-left:5%; padding-right:5%; padding-top:0; padding-bottom:0;\">\n\n\t\t\t<p>\n<h2>Apple Watch review: Straps<\/h2>\n<p>While we&#8217;re on the subject of straps, which one should you pick to go with your beautiful Apple Watch?<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-281\" src=\"https:\/\/jannah.tielabs.com\/jannah-tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/10\/2014\/04\/compare_large2.png\" alt=\"compare_large2\" width=\"944\" height=\"196\" \/><\/p>\n\n\t\t<div class=\"tie-padding  has-padding-left has-padding-right\" style=\"padding-left:5%; padding-right:5%; padding-top:0; padding-bottom:0;\">\n\n\t\t\t<p>There are a wide collection of straps to choose from, including: Link Bracelet, Sport Band, Leather Loop, Classic Buckle, Modern Buckle, Milanese Loop and more recently, Nylon band and Hermes straps.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"alignright quote-simple \"><p>The Leather Loop, Classic Buckle, Leather Loop, Modern Buckle<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The Leather Loop, Classic Buckle, Leather Loop, Modern Buckle, Woven Nylon and Sport Band options are offered in multiple colour choices while the Milanese Loop and Link Bracelet are only available in two colours. The Sport Band comes in 22 different colours including black, white, pink, yellow, blue, grey, lime green,\u00a0lavender, antique white, stone and midnight blue, for example.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\t\t<div id=\"screen\" data-title=\"Screen\" class=\"index-title\"><\/div>\n\t\n\n\t\t<div class=\"tie-padding  has-padding-left has-padding-right\" style=\"padding-left:5%; padding-right:5%; padding-top:0; padding-bottom:0;\">\n\n\t\t\t<p>\n<h2>Apple Watch review: Screen<\/h2>\n<p>While doing our best to extend the watch&#8217;s battery life, we wanted to force-quit some apps and found the method of doing so deeply counterintuitive.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-282 alignleft\" src=\"https:\/\/jannah.tielabs.com\/jannah-tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/10\/2014\/04\/bands_large-copy.jpg\" alt=\"bands_large-copy\" width=\"174\" height=\"370\" \/>Returning to the screen, the resolution depends on the watch you choose. The resolution of the screen on the 38mm Apple Watch (which measures 1.32 inches diagonally) is 272&#215;340 while the 42mm model offers 312&#215;390 on a screen that measures 1.5 inches. Both models, therefore, offer a pixel density of 326 pixels per inch, or ppi.<\/p>\n<p>In both cases, the Apple Watch screen is officially rated (or perhaps we should say branded) as Retina-quality, and our subjective experience with it has been great. It&#8217;s sharp and vividly colourful and we&#8217;ve yet to notice any pixellation.<\/p>\n<p>The touchscreen aspects work terrifically too: it&#8217;s highly responsive, and we found we tend to fall back on old habits, swiping through screens whenever possible by using the touchscreen even if a scrolling option is available via the Digital Crown. It ought to be as easy to quit apps and glances as it is on the iPhone &#8211; but it isn&#8217;t. To quit an app you have to press and hold the side button, and then do the same again. Nobody is going to stumble on that by accident.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\t\t<div id=\"user-interface\" data-title=\"User interface\" class=\"index-title\"><\/div>\n\t\n<h2 id=\"interface\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Apple Watch review: User interface<\/h2>\n\n\t\t<div class=\"tie-full-width-img\">\n\t\t\t<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-285 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/jannah.tielabs.com\/jannah-tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/10\/2014\/04\/edition_large.png\" alt=\"edition_large\" width=\"1350\" height=\"355\" \/>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\t\t<div class=\"tie-padding  has-padding-left has-padding-right\" style=\"padding-left:5%; padding-right:5%; padding-top:0; padding-bottom:0;\">\n\n\t\t\t<p>\n<p>Apple&#8217;s design expertise is only a small part of what makes the Apple Watch stand out. Another factor in its favour is the user interface. The problem many current smartwatches have is that the UI is packed onto a tiny display and you need to manipulate those tiny visual elements using your fingers, which are inevitably bigger than the elements you&#8217;re trying to touch.<\/p>\n<p>Below we examine Apple&#8217;s method for controlling the user interface, and the software you can expect to see on the Apple Watch.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\t\t<div id=\"using-screen\" data-title=\"Using screen\" class=\"index-title\"><\/div>\n\t\n\n\t\t<div class=\"tie-padding  has-padding-left has-padding-right\" style=\"padding-left:5%; padding-right:5%; padding-top:0; padding-bottom:0;\">\n\n\t\t\t<p>\n<h2>Apple Watch review: Using the Apple Watch screen<\/h2>\n<p>One way to use the Watch is via the screen. You can scroll around the screen, tap on items to select them or press harder to get more options &#8211; akin to using right click on a mouse. Various gestures bring up other elements of the operating system. For example, Glances are accessed by swiping up on the watch face.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\t\t<div class=\"tie-full-width-img\">\n\t\t\t<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-288\" src=\"https:\/\/jannah.tielabs.com\/jannah-tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/10\/2014\/04\/gallery_large-new2.png\" alt=\"gallery_large-new2\" width=\"1350\" height=\"700\" \/>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\t\t<div class=\"tie-padding  has-padding-left has-padding-right\" style=\"padding-left:5%; padding-right:5%; padding-top:0; padding-bottom:0;\">\n\n\t\t\t<p>\n<p>There&#8217;s also Apple&#8217;s Force Touch technology that determines how hard you are pressing the Watch and will act accordingly.

In other words, you ought to be able to get through a whole day, but that will be about it: expect to charge it every night.

Apple&#8217;s &#8216;typical day&#8217; included a half-hour workout, but if you exercise more than that you may use up the battery quicker &#8211; in Apple&#8217;s tests, the battery lasted 6.5 hours during a workout (so you should at least be able to run that marathon without running out of battery). If you use the Apple Watch to play music you will also find that to be a bit of a battery hog. Apple got 6.5 hours of audio playback out of the test device before it ran out of power.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\n\n\t\t<div id=\"pricing-and-availability\" data-title=\"Pricing and availability\" class=\"index-title\"><\/div>\n\t\n<h2>Apple Watch review: Apple Watch UK price<\/h2>\n<p>Pricing varies depending on the watch and strap you choose.
